      <p>
        I am a generalist by nature and by choice. My curiosity drives me to
        explore systems, tools, and processes, whether in software, photography,
        or building with Lego. I enjoy understanding how things work,
        identifying patterns, and finding ways to make complex systems
        predictable and reliable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professionally, I design and build software systems across multiple
        domains and platforms. But my pride in craft goes beyond coding. In
        Swedish, yrkesstolthet captures what motivates me: a dedication to doing
        things well, understanding the implications of every decision, and
        leaving work in a state better than I found it. This discipline shapes
        everything I do—from designing architectures and writing tests to
        documenting systems and refining processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of software, creativity plays an equally important role in my
        life. Photography lets me explore light, composition, and timing—skills
        that require patience, observation, and technical understanding. Lego
        and video games are more than hobbies; they are exercises in
        problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and system design. All of these
        pursuits reflect the same curiosity and drive for mastery that guide my
        professional work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I approach challenges with thoughtfulness, rigor, and a sense of
        curiosity. Whether it is designing a new software system, capturing a
        moment through a lens, or constructing a complex model, I aim for
        clarity, intentionality, and quality in everything I create. </p>

        What I Do
      </h2>

      <p>
        I work as a software developer across multiple domains and platforms, ranging from low-level embedded systems to
        modern application development.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work includes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Embedded C development for microcontrollers such as ATmega</li>

        <li>C++ development on Linux and Windows. (I am old enough to have used MFC!)</li>

        <li>C# and .NET MAUI development for Android</li>

        <li>Designing systems that are testable, well-documented, and specification-driven</li>

        <li>
          I am comfortable moving between constrained environments and high-level
          application stacks, and I enjoy understanding systems all the way down
          to their boundaries and failure modes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I am equally comfortable implementing a scripting-language from scratch
        as I am designing a web application using Angular/TypeScript, or
        implementing the application backend in C++. The last few years I have
        focused on low-level programming in C for the ATmega MCU series,
        implementing an EVSE based on the EN IEC 61851-1:2019 standard.

      <h2 class="block-title">
        Engineering Philosophy
      </h2>

      <p>
        I take pride in building software that is understandable, verifiable,
        and durable.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy reading and working from specifications, and I value precision
        in both implementation and communication. Writing tests and
        documentation is not a chore for me; it is part of the engineering
        process and a way to make systems trustworthy for future developers,
        including myself.
      </p>

      <p class="strong">
        I prefer simple, explicit designs over clever ones, and I aim to leave
        codebases in a better state than I found them.
      </p>

      <h3>Modern C++ in Practice</h3>

      <p>
        I use modern C++ as a means to write safer, clearer, and more expressive
        code—not as an end in itself. I actively leverage contemporary language
        and standard library features to make intent explicit and to shift
        correctness checks as early as possible, preferably to compile time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I use templates, constexpr, and strong types when they improve
        correctness, performance, or expressiveness, and when the resulting
        abstractions remain understandable. Where runtime flexibility or
        decoupling is required, I rely on well-defined interfaces and
        polymorphism. When neither is justified, I favor simple value semantics,
        composition, and free functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Resource management is handled consistently through RAII, avoiding
        manual lifetime management and making ownership rules explicit. I prefer
        standard library facilities over custom implementations, and I design
        APIs that are hard to misuse and easy to test.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach to modern C++ is pragmatic and disciplined: I use the full
        range of tools the language provides, but only when they meaningfully
        improve code quality, maintainability, or correctness.

      <p>
        Seafire is designed to model the HTTP/1.1 protocol as accurately and

        abstractions for representations, resources, routing, and protocol
        behavior. Every design choice is deliberate, balancing correctness,
        performance, and maintainability.

        A reporting engine designed for flexible output and integration.
        Hyperlane can optionally use libart-paperback for PDF generation and has
        future plans to support ZPL II for label printing. The project

        The project includes a graphical WYSIWYG designer tool implemented as an
        Angular library, intended to be embedded directly into the application

        Beyond Programming
      </h2>

      <p>
        While software is a major part of my life, it is far from the only lens
        through which I explore the world. My hobbies and creative pursuits
        reflect the same curiosity, problem-solving, and attention to detail
        that guide my professional work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photography is a creative and technical outlet for me. It combines
        observation, patience, and experimentation, rewarding both preparation
        and improvisation. I enjoy capturing moments with intention, exploring
        light, composition, and perspective, and continually refining my
        understanding of the medium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building with Lego allows me to think in terms of systems, structure,
        and modular design. Complex models are exercises in planning, iteration,
        and adaptability—skills that translate directly into software and
        engineering challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Video games provide both relaxation and a playground for strategic
        thinking. I appreciate titles that encourage problem-solving,
        experimentation, and creativity, and I often find inspiration in their
        mechanics and design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, these activities reflect a mindset of curiosity and
        craftsmanship that extends well beyond code. They remind me that
        thoughtful design, exploration, and iteration are valuable in every
        creative or technical endeavor.
